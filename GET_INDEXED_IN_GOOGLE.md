# How to Get Your Website Indexed in Google (Step-by-Step Guide)

Your website is live at: **https://wintechproject.onrender.com**

Now follow these steps to make it appear in Google search results:

---

## ✅ Step 1: Submit to Google Search Console (MOST IMPORTANT!)

This is the **#1 reason** why your site doesn't appear in search - Google hasn't discovered it yet!

### **1.1 Go to Google Search Console**
👉 https://search.google.com/search-console

### **1.2 Add Your Property**

1. Click the **"Add Property"** button (top left)
2. Choose **"URL prefix"** (recommended)
3. Enter your website URL exactly: `https://wintechproject.onrender.com`
4. Click **"Continue"**

### **1.3 Verify Ownership**

You already have the Google verification meta tag in your `index.html`:
```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="T6OHa-q4BjP0VgDokKJ9qyWmN1UNRQ975A5kZtoTTPk" />
```

**Verification Method:**
1. Choose **"HTML tag"** method
2. Google will show a meta tag - but you already have one!
3. Since your meta tag is already in your site, just click **"Verify"**
4. If it doesn't work, try the **"URL prefix"** method instead

**Alternative - URL Prefix Method:**
1. Choose **"URL prefix"**
2. Enter: `https://wintechproject.onrender.com`
3. Google will check your site for the verification meta tag
4. Click **"Verify"**

### **1.4 Submit Your Sitemap** ⭐

This tells Google all your pages:

1. In Search Console, go to **"Sitemaps"** (left sidebar)
2. Under **"Add a new sitemap"**, enter: `sitemap.xml`
3. Click **"Submit"**
4. Wait a few minutes, then refresh - you should see:
   - ✅ Status: "Success"
   - ✅ Discovered URLs: 6

### **1.5 Request Indexing**

This tells Google to crawl your site immediately:

1. Go to **"URL Inspection"** (left sidebar)
2. Enter: `https://wintechproject.onrender.com`
3. Click **"Test Live URL"**
4. Once it shows "URL is on Google" or "URL is not on Google", click **"Request Indexing"**
5. Repeat for these important pages:
   - `https://wintechproject.onrender.com/about`
   - `https://wintechproject.onrender.com/business`
   - `https://wintechproject.onrender.com/contact`
