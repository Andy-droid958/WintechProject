Your website's position in search results depends on several factors. Here's what you need to know:

## 🎯 Initial Timeline Expectations

### **First 1-2 Weeks:**

### **1-3 Months:**
- **Page**: Page 2-3 for some keywords
- **Why**: Google is still learning about your site
- **Status**: Your SEO improvements are working, but competition matters

### **3-6 Months:**
- **Page**: Page 1-2 for long-tail keywords (specific searches)
- **Page**: Page 2-3 for competitive keywords
- **Example**: "aluminum windows Malaysia Wintech" → Page 1 likely
